js-ppwcode-vernacular-semantics-private
=======================================

GETTING STARTED

This project is defined  with submodules.
To download the submodules, use the literal git commands:
> git submodule init
> git submodule update

This will download all needed submodules into lib/.





STRUCTURE

The main project files, with their associated tests, are located in

semantics/


When the submodules are downloaded, the tests should work out of the
box when you navigate your browser to

semantics/test/runTests.html


semantics/_util contains coded needed for the main code, that will
presumably appear in a separate project in a while.





DEMO

demo/ contains demonstration code for different features.
When the submodules are downloaded, this should work out of the box.
